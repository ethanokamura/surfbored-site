# About Me
A little about me: my name is Ethan Okamura. I am a computer science major with the end goal of obtaining a master's degree alongside practical experience in software engineering. With a decade of programming expertise and a background in teaching, my goal is to instill a love for programming in anyone who wants to take these courses while they have fun creating their dream projects. I am committed to the continuous journey of learning and higher education and strive to offer my students comprehensive knowledge and support.
